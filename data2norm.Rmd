## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Function to normalize a list or dataframe or tibble
# 1st I'll start as plan code, then convert it to a function
# I won't install andy packages in here...do I need anything special?

```{r}
data2norm = c(1:100) # This will be passed into the fnc later
data2norm_diff = (max(data2norm) - min(data2norm))
data_norm = data2norm/data2norm_diff
data_norm

```

```{r}
my_norm = function (data2norm){
  
data2norm_diff = (max(data2norm) - min(data2norm))
data_norm = data2norm/data2norm_diff
return (data_norm)
  
}

my_norm (c(1:20))
